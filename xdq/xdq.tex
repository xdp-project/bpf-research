\section{Introduction}

The Linux kernel is a widely used platform in devices that range from IoT
devices, cellphones, home and enterprise routers to servers and cloud offerings.
A common task done by all network equipment and devices is packet scheduling,
which the equipment uses to prioritize different traffic between hosts. On
smartphones, the packet scheduler might want to prioritize video streaming over
application updates. A cloud provider might wish to schedule fairness between
customers or even prioritize some customers over others. With the growing number
of devices and their diverse network requirements, there is a need for increased
flexibility in the rapid deployment and interaction with schedulers. However,
network equipment and devices tend to have a limited set of packet schedulers
available with a few parameters that the customers could control. Therefore,
researchers and network vendors have turned to programmable packet schedulers
to allow the customers to write schedulers optimized for their domain-specific
use cases.

Currently, the Linux kernel provides the Queuing Disciplines (Qdiscs) for
handling packet scheduling. Adding new Qdiscs requires writing new Linux kernel
modules in the C programming language. However, kernel modules have full access
to the Linux kernel internals and do not provide a safe execution environment. A
minor bug in a Qdisc could crash the whole kernel. Consequently, vendors tend
not to provide third-party Qdiscs because of security reasons. Third-party
providers also need to recompile their modules for every kernel update, which
further limits the deployment of specialized packet schedulers. Therefore, to
support programmable schedulers that can be rapidly and safely deployed, we
propose two programmable packet scheduling frameworks for the Linux kernel using
the eBPF execution environment. The eBPF framework is an in-kernel runtime
environment that allows specialized code to execute within the kernel safely and
without being recompiled. Our first framework is a Qdisc called eBPF-Qdisc,
which allows the programmer to write new packet schedulers in eBPF that can use
all existing Qdisc infrastructures. The second framework we call Express Data
Queueing (XDQ) and expands upon Express Data Path
(XDP)\cite{hoiland2018express}. XDP is a framework that allows programmers to
attach eBPF code to the network interface's transmit path. These programs can
alter and redirect the packets, giving the programmer the option of bypassing
the Linux kernel's network stack for added performance, including the Qdisc
layer. XDQ extends on XDP by providing programmers with the ability to write
packet schedulers for the XDP datapath.

\begin{itemize}
\item Explain the structure of this technical report.
\end{itemize}

\section{Packet Scheduling, Traffic Shaping, and Queue Management}

The main function of the packet scheduler is to arrange or rearrange packets
in order to meet some specific criteria. However, they can also be used to shape
traffic.

\todo[inline]{Frey: This text should not sound like it is explaining packet scheduling from scratch. We assume that the audience have the main overview of what a packet scheduler is.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain the basic concepts of packet schedulers.
  \item Explain the difference between schedulers and queues.
  \item Explain the difference between a work-conserving and non-work conserving scheduling.
  \item Use a short round-robin scheduling example.
\end{itemize}

\section{Linux Kernel Networking Subsystem}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain on a high level the Linux Kernel Networking stack using a diagram.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Linux Kernel Packet Queueing Discipline (Qdisc)}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain where in the network pipe the Qdiscs are located.
  \item Explain, without going into too much detail, what the Qdisc system is capable of.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Shaping: Shaping delay packets to meet a desired rate.
          \item Scheduling: Schedulers arrange and/or rearrange packets for output.
          \item Classifying: Classifiers sort or separate traffic into queues.
          \item Policing: Policiers measure and limit traffic in a particular queue.
          \item Dropping: Dropping discards an entire packet, flow or classification.
          \item Marking: Marking is a mechanism by which the packet is altered.
        \end{itemize}
  \item Explain what type of primitives the Qdiscs system supplies:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Classfull Qdiscs.
          \item Classless Qdiscs.
          \item Filters.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Packet Schedulers in Practice}

\todo[inline]{Frey: This section needs a new name. The idea with this section is to explain why we care about this work and what the requirements are.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain what is not possible using today's packet schedulers.
  \item Explain why you would like to be able to schedule traffic
\end{itemize}


\section{Programmable Packet Schedulers}

\todo[inline]{Frey: Maybe this section could be combined with the above section if we find a better name for them.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain how programmable packet schedulers differ from traditional schedulers.
  \item Explain what we want from a programmable packet scheduler.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Can handle work and non-work conserving scheduling.
          \item Can combine data structures to form a hierarchy for more advanced algorithms.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\todo[inline]{Frey: In the original draft I had a special section called algorithm for each of the data structures below. I decided to remove it for now because I think it is intertwined with the data structure.}


\subsection{PIFO and SP-PIFO}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain what PIFO\cite{Sivaraman2016} is.
  \item Explain how PIFO does not allow scheduling at dequeue, but can form hierarchies to create more complex logic.
  \item Explain that SP-PIFO\cite{Alcoz2020} approximates the behavior of a PIFO using Strict-Priority queues.
  \item Explain that does not support non-work conserving scheduling.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Data Structure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain how the PIFO is an array of queues.
  \item Explain how the PIFO tends to not scale with large sizes. Mainly in hardware based scheduling.
  \item Explain how the SP-PIFO is a small PIFO that approximates larger PIFO.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Eiffel}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain how Eiffel\cite{Saeed2019} data structure is designed for software based scheduling and that it is optimized using find-first-set instructions.
  \item Explain that it can change the order of the packets on dequeue, unlike PIFO.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Data Structure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain that it uses a bitmap to keep track of available slots for optimization with FFS commands.
  \item Explain that it uses two alternating data structures to allow incremental inserts while not needing to scale the bitmaps dynamically.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Calendar-queues}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain that it supports both work and non-work conserving scheduling.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Data Structure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain that it uses a circular buffer with a hand like an analog clock. The slots represent when the scheduler will dequeue in the future. While the hand points to the packets that are dequeing.
\end{itemize}


\section{The extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)}

The eBPF framework is an in-kernel runtime environment that allows specialized
programs to execute in the kernel safely. These programs attach themselves to
hooks provided by the different subsystems of the kernel. These hooks limit what
the programs can do and define what type of eBPF programs can exist. These types
of programs vary but predominantly, they are related to networking, tracing, and
security. At its core, eBPF is an instruction set. However, as a framework, it
provides a key-value store that enables inter-process communication called eBPF
maps, in-kernel helper functions, and toolchains to create and manage eBPF
programs from user-space.

\todo[inline]{Frey: Because we all know what eBPF is, I am going to collapse these eBPF sections and make it shorter and simpler.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain h
  \item Explain eBPF maps and their scope.
  \item Explain what hooks are and that eBPF allows helper functions.
  \item Explain how eBPF programs are loaded using the bpf system call.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Instruction-set}

\todo[inline]{Frey: I think I will remove this section either completely, or at least remove the extra details.}

The eBPF instruction set is 64-bit and consists of eleven registers listed in
table ~\ref{table:eBPF_registers}. It contains a little over a hundred
instructions. However, the current format defines the opcode as the first octet
of the instruction. Therefore, in the current design, it could only support 256
instructions. The currently available instructions are limited to Arithmetic
Logic Unit (ALU) instructions, byte-swap instructions for Endian handling,
memory, and branch instructions.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
  \label{tab:freq}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \toprule
    Register & Type                    \\
    \midrule
    R0       & Return value            \\
    R1-R5    & Parameters to functions \\
    R6-R9    & Callee saved registers  \\
    R10      & Read-only stack pointer \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{table:eBPF_registers}
\end{table}


\subsection{Express Data Path (XDP)}

XDP is a type of eBPF program that are attached directly to the RX path of a
network interface.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain that XDP hooks directly to the RX path of a network driver and allows direct manipulation of the packet.
  \item Explain how XDP allows you to bypass the Linux network stack and redirect or drop the packets.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{eBPF Qdisc Classifiers}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain that the Qdisc layer currently supports two types of eBPF programs. These programs are a eBPF based classifier and filters.
  \item Explain why these eBPF programs
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain how we fulfill our requirements for a programmable schedulers using eBPF.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item How we want to either use eBPF helpers or eBPF maps to manipulate packet scheduling data structures.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{eBPF-Qdisc}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain the building blocks of Cong Wang's eBPF-Qdisc.
  \item Explain that is a classfull Qdisc.
  \item Explain what changes are needed to make it better.
  \item Explain the limitations of the eBPF-Qdisc.
\end{itemize}


\section{eXpress Data Queueing (XDQ)}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain where XDQ attaches into XDP.
  \item Explain what changes are needed to make it a reality.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation of eBPF-Qdisc and XDQ}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Compare a type of scheduling algorithm using eBPF-Qdisc and XDQ performance to Qdiscs that does the same functionality.
  \item Compare eBPF-Qdisc and XDQ performance to eachother.
