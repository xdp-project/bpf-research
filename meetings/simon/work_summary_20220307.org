* Red Hat hands on meeting
- Last Week Jesper and Toke were here and helped search for performance issues
  - We suspect one of the issues with many flows is related to increased L2 cache misses
  - We identified hash map lookups as one of the main contributers to overhead
  - We have identified two different ways to reduce the number of hash map lookups that should greatly help
    - Refcount of timestamp entries to avoid uncecessary misses
    - Combine both directions of flow to single entry

* Issue with measurement of TCP throughut
- Noticed that the calculated TCP throughput I had was often higher than the "raw" throughput measured at the PPing interface
  - Seems like the metrics "bytes_sent" used to calculate TCP throughput included retransmissions
  - All the packets seem to be dropped on the other interface on the forwarding machine (before they get to the PPing interface)
- I can likely correct this issue by subtracing "bytes_retransmitted"

* Other
- Should I take the Data management course?
  - Still in pilot phase, does not grant any points
- Feel a bit behind on everything right now
  - Research ethics and stats going ok
  - Bit behind on data plane programming
  - Bit behind on institutional duty (TRUEdig)
  - Behind on my own research
- Course load should drop next week once Research Ethics is done

* Plan    
- While still very busy with courses, will try to fix refcount to next week
- Will also try to fix TCP throughput and PPing packet rate stats if enough time
