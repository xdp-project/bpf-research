* PPing
- Not much to report
- Started setting up physical machines
  - Pretty old hardware, i7-3770 and i7-4790 CPUs (released 2012 and 2014)
    - Will use the older one for forwarding/PPing (bottleneck)
  - Currently only have 1G NICs
    - Can hopefully order 10G ones
  - One of the machines had a defective harddrive, has been replaced
  - One was using 60% of a CPU core for kacpi_notify, seems to have been fixed with updated kernel

** PPing - New testing metodolgy
- Currently measure CPU utalization of entire machine + network throughput
  - Toke pointed out that it may be hard getting consistent result because machine might run random background tasks
  - Paper from Simone stated it was hard getting consistent result without pinning CPUs for packet processing
- Toke suggested different approach
  - Don't measure CPU
  - Look at overhead in terms of reduced throughput
  - To bottleneck, pin all packet processing to single core
  - Pin PPing/ePPing to separate CPU core

** PPing - IMC poster
- Sent in an extended abstrace to IMC which got accepted
- Now I need to make a poster
  - A0 portrait recommended
  - Deadline 25/10
- I've never made a poster before, any template we typically use?
- Poster session will be virtual, poster shared via share-screen

* Courses
- This is where I spend most of my time currently
  - Philosophy and Theory of Science ~80h left until 22/11
  - KLL ~40h left until 22/11
  - ~100h left in DISCO-reading to end of year (although I think is is overprovisioned, estimate I need ~40-50h)
- In my ISP we've also put 5 cred. (~130h) for litterature study this term
  - Might need to delay?
- Johan E recently mailed about RRR (Frameworks, rules and resources) course, relevant for me?

* Institutional duty
- Currently 20% in DVGA01
  - So far only been about 15%
  - Will likely be a bit more than 20% next week when final lab is handed in
- Will be in DVGB03 from 8/11
  - Heard there will be a lot of students there, so will probably effectivly be at least 20%

* Other
- AIDA WP2 workshop tomorrow - anything I need to prepare?
- Have schedules for the upcomming DISCO meetings been sent out?
- From 8/11 I will always have supervision until 15:00 on mondays - collides with this meeting 

- Plan:
  - Course stuff
  - PPing poster
  - Try Toke's testing methodolgy
  - Finish configuring real machines and replicate tests on them
