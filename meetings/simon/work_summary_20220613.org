* Overview
- Have spent a fair amount of time trying to refactor ePPing to make use of global functions
  - Think I've got it working now?
  - Down to about 200k insn
  - Still some additional fixes required before ready for Toke to review
- Worked a bit on updating the ISP and related admin. work
- Updated SNCNW paper

* ePPing
- Make parsing packet a global function
- Had to move one struct to a PER_CPU_ARRAY to avoid stack too large
  - Struct can no longer contain packet pointers
  - Need to fix FIB lookup (for local filtering)

* ISP
- Last decided: 2021-09-24
  - But that was very late, and think it would be nice if we could get it in before the summer
- Have not really had any more COVID-related delays?
- Mainly want to discuss the overall project plan and courses

** ISP project plan
- Have pretty much just added some discussed directions to the short-term plan (before lic)
  - Integration of ePPing into observability framework
  - Internet measurement study
  - Add QUIC
  - Measure container network latency
  - Order of these?
- What to do with old parts on developing system monitoring and performance monitoring tools
- Whole part after lic was basically on optimization
  - Is this still relevant, and if so, how does it tie together with my current work

** ISP courses
- Have 5 courses for next semester (HT22)
  - CS Colloquium (1.5 ECTS, delayed from this semester)
  - Peer reviewing in CS (2 ECTS)
  - Another DISCO seminar course? (4.5 ECTS?)
  - Litterature study (5 ECTS)
  - Some course in containerization/virtualization? (2.5 ECTS?)
- The "open" slots are course in cont./virt. (2.5) and course in ML/optimization (3)
- How to fill goal matrix for missing/underdetermined courses?
- Linux kernel hacking course?

* Other
- Salary ladder 25% point should be reached by now?  
- The SNCNW conference is later this week, so need to prepare presentation
- When to start meetings after summer?
