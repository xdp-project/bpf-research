* PPing - Improved map cleanup
- Used static 300s timeout to remove old flows
- Have added shorter 30s timeout for "non-opened" flows (seen no reply) and ICMP
- Working on adding RTT-based timeout for timestamp entries

* PPing - Performance tests
- Have had problems replicating results - large variations between runs
  - Tried waiting 5 min between runs - no difference
- Based on discussions with Anna & Red Hat, still belive it could be connected to the VMs and their networking
- Also observed some other strange behavior, such as only every ~16th packet getting ACKed
- Currently in process of setting up 3 physical machines
  - If variations gone - likely some issue with VM setup
  - Otherwise, issue with test setup (iperf? Linux network conf?)

* PPing - IMC poster
- On Friday Anna notified me that [[https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2021/cfposters/][ACM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) 2021]] has a poster session
- Deadline was extened to 22/9
- Think it could be a good opportunity to get some early feedback on pping
- Will need to throw together an extended abstract (2 pages) by Wednesday

* Other
- Lab supervision in DVGA01
- Courses
  - DISCO reading - seminar today
  - KLL - next meeting on 24/9
- Linux Plumbers Conference (LPC 2021)
  - 16:00 - 20:00 this entire week
