* PPing
- Added "flow events" (end/start of flow)
- Switched to libbpf's new API for attaching tc programs
  - No longer need to rely on external scrips calling the tc command
  - No longer need to temporarily pin the program
- Have updated document on measurement study

** PPing: Measurement study
- Have updated my [[https://github.com/simosund/bpf-examples/blob/Measurement_study/pping/MEASUREMENT_STUDY.md][document]] on measurement-study related issues a bit
- The anonymization part is still challenging
  - Think we should keep port numbers
  - Think we should use some 1-to-1 mapping for IP anonymization, ex CryptoPan
    - Vunlerable to traffic injection attacks and predictible traffic patterns
- Intend for the [[https://github.com/xdp-project/bpf-examples/pull/17][PR]] to be used to discuss it, but so far empty

** PPing: Performance study
- Before we do the measurement study, should probably do the performance analysis
- Last time we discussed a setup with 3 machines
  - data source -> middlebox with pping -> data sink
- Javid could help with setting up some VMs for this?
- Limited experience, how do I go about this?
  - Read up, write some scripts, ask for feedback?

* Reported study activity and financing
- Got a mail from Sara Westlindh about study activity and financing
  - She had reported it in LADKOk
  - Wanted to know if info in ISP was accurate
  - Can't find the info in the ISP?

* ISP didn't pass
- They require a more detailed time-plan
  - Mainly 2 year long phase on developing framework+tools for monitoring
  - Also 2 year long phase on optimization/automation methods based on monitoring
  - Also need supervisor comments on COVID related delays
- Should probably revise it ASAP?

* AIDA WP2 meeting
- WP2 meeting tomorrow
- This presentation was supposed to cover various frameworks from KaU's side?
- Once again, nothing for me to really prepare?

* Plan
- Revise ISP
- Check out MedComNet (mainly keynotes and session 4)
- Minor pping cleanup
- Mainly work on performance analysis?
