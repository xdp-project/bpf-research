* PPing
- Have updated test setup based on feedback from last meeting
  - In total a 3 minute iperf3 test, but omitting the first minute from the results
  - On physical machines, packet processing was already pinned to one core per NIC
  - Tests still take about 1h per run (3min * 3 PPing variants * 5 flow variants + compression and plotting)
  - Results seem a bit more stable (...from sample size of 2 sets of runs)
- Now sync measurements based on time instead of CPU-load
- Updated map cleaning plotting script to work with new bpf_iter cleanup

** Variations between runs with new setup
- 2 different sets of 10 runs

** Pinning everything to single core
- Pinning both NICs and PPing to same core gives strange result
- Single flow on left, 100 flows on right

** New map cleanup works much better
- Old on left, new on right

* Physical machines
- Have gotten 2 10G NICs from Jonas, so just missing 1 now
  - He may get one from Hub, or he may order another one
- Toke has given me access to his testbed which has 100G NICs
  - Has similar setup (3 machines in chain topology), should not take much effort to adapt test scripts
  - Not sure I can hit 100G with iperf3 (single instance, single flow ~30G)
