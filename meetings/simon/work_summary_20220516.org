* Overview
- Sent in the SNCNW paper
- Working on experiments for the IMC paper
  - Testing the limits of Kathie's PPing program
  - Testing the accuracy of the TCP RTT estimates from ePPing
- Have not written much on the actual IMC paper yet...

* (Kathie's) PPing limits
- Tested at what throughput Kathie's PPing starts missing packets
  - Appears to be around 3.7 Gbps
  - Only tested single flow on my standard testbed setup
- Should I have some figure of this in paper?
  - Packets per second handled by interface/PPing at various throughputs?
  - Fraction of all packets handled by PPing at various throughputs?
- Packet count don't match up exactly, unclear why

* TCP RTT accuracy
- Use a similar setup as for overhead test
  - TCP flow between endhosts, monitor on middlebox
  - Middlebox using no offloads, single core
  - Limited to 1 Gbps so tcpdump can capture all packets
  - Varied netem delay on reciever
- Issues with using hardware clocks with tcpdump (gave 90 ms RTT when it should be ~0)
- ePPing matches RTTs from PPing very well
- Depending on tuned-adm profile on endhosts, tcptrace/tshark give quite different results
- Unsure how to present results in a consice manner

* IMC paper plan
- Have focused on results until now
- Will largely reuse SNCNW paper
- Planned changes from SNCNW paper
  - Extend description of BPF (approx one paragraph)
  - Add back ICMP RTT accuracy results
  - Add TCP accuracy results (a bit unclear)
  - Extend details on experiment setup
  - Extend explanation on why throughput drops with nr flow
    - Add a figure on ex. processed packets?
  - Add results on when PPing starts missing packets
    - Possibly add figure?
  - Maybe split introduction into related work section?
  - Ethics section?

** Time plan
- Will try to have inital draft done by tonight
- Have ok-ish version to hand in on Wednesday
- Use inital part of Thursday to polish further (deadline is Thursday 14:00 CEST)
- Will be very tight again (sorry for that)
