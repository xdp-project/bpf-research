* PPing
- Not much to report
- Have added some additional map cleaning debug info
  - Can now compare nr entries deleted "automatically" (matched) vs timed out
  - Will update plotting scripts to show this
- Played around a little with offloads and RFS (Receive Flow Steering)
- Started setting up physical machines...
  - Pretty old hardware, i7-3770 and i7-4790 CPUs (released 2012 and 2014)
  - One of the machines was missing a harddrive...
  - Another is using 60% of a CPU core for kacpi_notify, need to check it up

* PPing - New testing metodolgy
- Currently measure CPU utalization of entire machine + network throughput
  - Toke pointed out that it may be hard getting consistent result because machine might run random background tasks
  - Paper from Simone stated it was hard getting consistent result without pinning CPUs
- Toke suggested different approach
  - Don't measure CPU
  - Look at overhead in terms of reduced throughput
  - To bottleneck, pin all packet processing to single core
  - Pin PPing/ePPing to separate CPU core

* Courses
- Philosphy and Theory of Science started with no warning
  - Has a pretty hectic schedule - 120h over the comming 5 weeks (22/11)
- Also have about ~40h for KLL course in the comming 5 weeks
- Also 20% institutional duty
- So not that much time over to actually work on PPing related stuff right now

* Other
- CNCF is hosting [[https://www.cncf.io/events/cloud-native-ebpf-north-america/][eBPF]] day today (starts 18:00) - registration $20
  - Will also be recorded and uploaded to youtube
  - [[https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cloud-native-ebpf-day-north-america/program/schedule/][Schedule]]
- Frey presents during session 3 of Inria WOS 2021 tomorrow
  - [[https://team.inria.fr/wide/wos/][Registration]] is open until 16:00 today
- Perhaps relevant for Frey
  - Toke and I attended a meeting with Dave Tath where Matt Mathis presented his roundsgate concept
  - Basically buffer all packets for some interval (ex 100ms) and then transmit them all
    - Useful for testing purposes, descretizing TCP congestion windows
  - Could maybe be added to the list of "example implementations"?
- My supervision meetings (18/10 and 8/11) collide with seminars in theory of science
