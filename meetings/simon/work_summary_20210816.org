* PPing
- Timestamp and match on both ingress and egress
- Wait for response before "opening" connection
- Switched src and dest
- Some performance tests

** PPing - handling both directions
- Kathie's pping timestamped and matched in both directions
- Originally I only timestamped on egress and matched on ingress
  - If you wanted to measure both directions, run multiple instances of pping
  - This approach would not really work at the ISP due to how they used NAT?
- Doing both directions adds some additional complexities
  - FIN will close one direction, RST both
  - Have added "match_on_egress" field to JSON output to seperate between entries that include local processing time and not
  - Have added optional "local filtering" to avoid RTTs for traffic to the local host
    - Implemented by FIB lookup (please have a look at this)

*** PPing - both directions - code changes
- Ending up rewriting significant part of BPF code
  - Rejected by verifier on 5.4 kernel (which my VMs use...)
  - Despite more complicated code, verifier passes it much faster now (850k -> 150k proc. ins.)
- Should probably have some tests by now...

** PPing - wait for response before opening flow
- Used to simply report flow opened/closed when I created/deleted a flow entry
  - Will report some uncessary open/close events for flows we never get a response from
- Will now wait for a response before reporting flow opened
  - Do still not wait for final ACK in SYN -> SYN-ACK -> ACK handshake
  - Will still timestamp initial SYN-packet
- Will only report on flow closing if it has been first been "opened"
- Introduces unlikely concurrency issue where multiple flow-opened reports are pushed

** PPing - switch src and dest
- Used to report src and dest from the timestamped packet's perspective
- To be consistent with Kathie's pping, instead use reply-packet's perspective
- Ex. RTT for packet going A -> B -> A (with pping on A)
  - Would before report A as src and B as dest
  - Will now report B as src and A as dest

** PPing - performance tests
- Managed to get started after resolving an ARP flux issue
- Still simple iperf3 tests
- Small writeup [[https://github.com/simosund/bpf-examples/blob/Measurement_study/pping/measurements/MEASUREMENT_STUDY.md#some-more-thorough-iperf3-tests-2021-07-16][here]], full results on [[https://kau.app.box.com/s/epoif0wi2qlffjxpcwmg4ibv7lsojwvo][Box]]
  - eBPF pping = epping, Kathie's pping = kpping
- epping works well for single flow, falls appart for many flows
  - Pushing and printing many RTT events has big performance impact
  - Timestamp map quickly fills up
  - Map cleaning inefficient and somewhat broken
- Large variations between runs, will repeat tests once I can access VMs again

* The things I didn't do..
- Missed the netdev conference
  - Traveling in regions with poor connectivity
- Didn't send anything in to the IAB workshop
  - Rewriting pping and tests took longer than I anticipated

* Other
- eBPF summit 18-19/8
- I go on vacation (again) next week
- Will start as lab supervisor in programming techniques (DVGA01)
